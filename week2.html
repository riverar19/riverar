<h1>Week Two</h1>
<h3>Week Two Drawings on Fusion 360</h3>




<p> This week the class learned how to use Fusion 360 to creat and build 3d models of sketches that could possibly be printed later on. These drawing while fun were a little bit hard to get done due to my lack of understanding of how to use all of the tools in the program. Thankfully, Nate was there to lend me a hand whenever Mr. Gerber was busy.</p>

<p> The porject was succesful as I know have experience of dealing with fusion and thinkI can continue on my own without too much difficutly from here going foward. </p>

  <p>In the second challenge we were tasted to build something that would catch a falling golf ball. There could only be three straws touching the floor so we tried cutting straws to have the same amount of straws touching the floor with more points of structure. Unfourtanetly we all communicated poorly and did not create a succesful structure. </p>
